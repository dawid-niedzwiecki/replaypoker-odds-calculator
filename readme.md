# ReplayPoker.com Texas Hold'em Odds Calculator

### This is a Texas Hold'em odds calculator. It displays the winning, losing and tying chances of your current hand.

#### No need to define your hands or the community cards by yourself in order for the script to work.

#### The onlyissue I had was to determine when an opponent has folded their hand. For this case, the scripts injects a button on the poker table for the player to push it when an opponent folds. It recalculates the odds accordingly then.

# Setup:
1. Run the node server using `node main.js`
2. Join a poker table on ReplayPoker.com
3. Paste the code from `in_browser.js` into the browsers console.
4. Wait for the script to catch up (should start working on the next game)
